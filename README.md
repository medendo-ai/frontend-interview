# Medendo Tech Frontend Interview

## Code Review & Cleanup Challenge

Welcome to the Medendo Tech frontend interview challenge! This exercise is designed to assess your code review skills, attention to detail, and ability to improve existing code.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, you will be presented with a frontend codebase that requires review and cleanup.

The codebase is a simple transcription app that uses the Web Speech API to transcribe audio. Note that the Web Speech API is a free service - it doesn't garuantee privacy.
However, there are several issues that need to be addressed.

## Instructions

1. **Review the Code**: Carefully examine the provided codebase to identify issues and areas for improvement.

2. **Document Issues**: Create a list of the problems you've identified, explaining why each is problematic.

3. **Implement Solutions**: Make the necessary changes to address the issues you've found. Focus on:

   - Improving code readability and maintainability
   - Enhancing performance
   - Ensuring accessibility compliance
   - Fixing bugs and handling edge cases
   - Applying consistent patterns and best practices

4. **Explain Your Changes**: For each significant change, provide a brief explanation of:
   - What you changed
   - Why you made the change
   - How your solution improves the codebase

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- Thoroughness of your code review
- Quality and correctness of your solutions
- Code organization and readability
- Attention to detail
- Understanding of frontend best practices
- Explanation of your thought process

## Submission

Please submit your improved code as a pull request to this repository.

## Time Expectation

You should aim to spend approximately 2-3 hours on this challenge. It's not expected that you find or fix every possible issue â€“ we're more interested in seeing your approach to code review and your ability to analyse problems and prioritize improvements.

Good luck!

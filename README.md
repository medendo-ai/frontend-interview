# Medendo Tech Frontend Interview

## Code Review & Cleanup Challenge

Welcome to the Medendo Tech frontend interview challenge! This exercise is designed to assess your code review skills, attention to detail, and ability to improve existing code.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, you will be presented with a vibe-coded frontend that requires review and cleanup.

The codebase is a simple transcription app that uses the Web Speech API to transcribe audio. Note that the Web Speech API is a free service - it doesn't garuantee privacy.

There are several issues that need to be addressed.

## Instructions

1. **Review the Code**: Carefully examine the provided codebase to identify issues and areas for improvement.

2. **Document Issues**: Create a list of the problems you've identified, explaining why each is problematic.

3. **Implement Solutions**: Make the necessary changes to address the issues you've found. Focus on:
   - Improving code simplicity, readability and maintainability.
   - Enhancing performance
   - Ensuring accessibility compliance
   - Fixing bugs and handling edge cases
   - Applying consistent patterns and best practices

4. **Explain Your Changes**: For each significant change, provide a brief explanation of:
   - What you changed
   - Why you made the change
   - How your solution improves the codebase

## Evaluation Criteria

5 things we like to see:

- Your present a clear code review / diagnosis of the flaws of the existing app.
- You apply best practices and demonstrate good code structure and readability
- You have a clean .git history that shows what was changed and why
- You've done something to improve the app from an end-users POV.
- You show pragmatism: you focus on activities with a large "ROI".

## Submission

Please submit your improved code as a pull request - in this repository or your own.
